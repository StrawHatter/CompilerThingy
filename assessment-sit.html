Assessment</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document defines an assessment in which you are required to develop
a partial compiler for the language <strong>PAL</strong> (Pretty Awful Language).
You will only be building the <strong>frontend</strong> of the compiler: you need to
implement parsing and semantic analysis, but you don't need to implement
artifact generation.</p>
<p>Please read through the whole of this document carefully before starting
work, including the <strong>Submission</strong> and <strong>Grading Criteria</strong> sections.
It's important to note that a detailed assessment of your code will
not be made; your work is assessed through the correctness of the
compiler's operation and the quality of your report describing an aspect
of the compiler's operation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact me
(<strong>a.sampson@abertay.ac.uk</strong>).</p>
<h2>Software Requirements</h2>
<p>The overall objective of this assignment is to develop a parser and
semantic analyser for the language <strong>PAL</strong>, encapsulated within a
command-line application that will enable a user to process a PAL
program to verify its <strong>syntactic</strong> and <strong>semantic</strong> correctness.</p>
<p>Your primary source document for this is 
<a href="PAL.EBNF.txt">the EBNF specification of PAL</a>,
which includes commentary on the semantics of the language.</p>
<p>I will run your compiler application inside an automated test harness
when marking it, so you need to keep the compiler's interface very
simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your compiler application must take the name of the PAL program file
  as its only command-line argument (i.e. in C#, the first element of
  the array of arguments passed to <code>Main</code>).</li>
<li>Error messages should be printed to standard output, with the compiler
  <strong>printing nothing</strong> if the PAL program is correct.</li>
<li>The compiler must not expect any user input other than the
  command-line arguments, or display a GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly suggest that you use C# and the Ardkit framework &mdash;
which we used in previous practicals &mdash; to implement your compiler.
If you'd like to use a different language or framework, I'm happy for
you to do so, but you <strong>must</strong> contact me by email to confirm that it'll
meet the assessment requirements before starting work.</p>
<p>I've provided a pre-written scanner for PAL for you to use as the basis
for your compiler; here is the
<a href="PALScanner.cs">PALScanner.cs source file</a> and (for reference)
<a href="PAL.FSM.txt">the FSM that it implements</a>.
This source file is complete; please don't modify it in any way.</p>
<h2>Suggested Activities</h2>
<p>Following is a methodology that you can follow in developing your
compiler.
This process will enable you to build up your application step by step,
testing each stage as it is completed so that you know the next step is
being built on a sound foundation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the <a href="PAL.EBNF.txt">EBNF specification for PAL</a>, noting the
   different forms that the declarations and statements can take.</li>
<li>Write some programs in the language, to check your understanding
   of the syntax and to act as test programs for the compiler as it is
   developed.</li>
<li>Download the C# scanner file that has been provided.</li>
<li>Ensure you know how to use the Ardkit framework classes by referring
   back to previous lectures, practicals and examples; ask if you are in
   doubt.</li>
<li>Develop a "pure" recursive-descent parser for PAL.  This will be
   defined as a class inheriting from the <code>RecoveringRdParser</code> class in
   the Ardkit compiler toolkit library.</li>
<li>Write the main application that will instantiate the parser and
   provide an appropriate command-line interface.</li>
<li>Test your "pure" parser by running your application against a suite
   of test programs (which you'll need to write).
   Your testing should ensure that valid programs are verified as such,
   and that <strong>syntactically invalid</strong> programs have their errors
   reported correctly.</li>
<li>Add semantic analysis to the parser.
   This will involve developing a semantic analysis class and symbol
   table mechanism, based around the Ardkit compiler toolkit framework.
   Ardkit includes a range of error classes that should be sufficient
   for most projects; you can also add new error classes if you feel you
   need them.</li>
<li>Test that semantic analysis works correctly by again running your
   application against a suite of test programs.
   This should include valid programs and programs that are
   syntactically valid but <strong>semantically invalid</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a complete and correct parser and semantic analyser
for the PAL language.</p>
<h2>Report Requirements</h2>
<p>Your submission is assessed by the correctness of the operation of your
compiler and the quality of your report.
The report must include the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name and student number.</li>
<li>A summary of how complete your compiler implementation is in terms of
  parsing and semantic analysis.
  This should include information on why you have confidence in your
  statement of completeness (e.g. how you've tested the compiler).</li>
<li>A detailed explanation of the operation of your syntactic and semantic
  analysis for <code>VarDecls</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect the report to be about three sides of A4 for a typical project.
(If you feel you need to write much more than this, please contact me!)</p>
<p>In explaining how your analysis operates you should include how the
input is parsed/scanned and the way in which the corresponding semantic
analysis is carried out. 
This description should make reference to specific extracts from your
own code to illustrate your explanation of what is going on and why.</p>
<p>As indicated in the <strong>Grading Criteria</strong> section, the maximum grade
available depends on the extent to which your compiler completes both
parsing and semantic analysis phases; within that, the quality of your
report in terms of its accuracy, completeness, insight and appraisal
will determine the actual grade awarded.
Your report should be in terms of what you have actually completed.</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>You must submit a ZIP file containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An electronic copy of the report as a PDF document.</li>
<li>The compiled <code>.exe</code> of your PAL compiler, that I can run against my
  own test suite of sample PAL programs.</li>
<li>The complete source code for your compiler.</li>
<li>Your test suite of valid and invalid PAL programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your ZIP file must be submitted by <strong>23:59 on Tuesday 30th April</strong>,
using CMP409's "Submit Module Assessment" page on Blackboard.</p>
<p>Feedback will be available on Tuesday 21st May (15 working days after
submission).</p>
<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>The coursework will be assessed using the following criteria;</p>
<ul>
<li>The correctness and completeness of your application when executed
  against a suite of test PAL programs, and</li>
<li>the quality of the report in terms of its accuracy, completeness,
  appraisal, explanations and insight.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>maximum</strong> grade that can be achieved under both criteria depends
on the extent to which you have completed and reported on the compiler
in terms of both parsing and semantic analysis.</p>

<p>The above maximum grades will be awarded if the accompanying report satisfies the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>The report accurately reflects the completeness of the compiler,
  including supporting evidence. </li>
<li>The report accurately describes and explains fully the operation
  of the syntactic and semantic processing in the <code>VarDecls</code>
  recogniser method.</li>
<li>The report includes critical appraisal and evidence of insight in its
  commentary on completeness and operation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Grades below the maximum grade will be awarded to reflect a relatively
poorer quality of implementation and report.</p></body>
